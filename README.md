# project_on_bitcoin_node

This Project is used to see the variation of the neighborhood of a full node in Bitcoin. First we have a JSON file and we convert that in a CSV file using pandas. Then from 2 csv files take the nodes disconnected and write them on a specific file that contain all this nodes. On that file is possibile create a Gantt chart using the python's module matplotlib.
